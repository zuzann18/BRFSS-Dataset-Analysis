# BRFSS Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)** dataset, focusing on descriptive analysis techniques for healthcare research. The BRFSS is a comprehensive annual survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor health-related behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventive services in the United States.

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
- **Dataset**: BRFSS 2014

### Key Characteristics of the Dataset
- **Population**: U.S. adults aged 18 and older.
- **Sample Size**: Over 15,000 records (in the uploaded sample).
- **Variables**: 29 columns, including demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related information.
  - Example variables:
    - **SEQN**: Unique respondent identifier.
    - **RIAGENDR**: Gender.
    - **RIDAGEYR**: Age.
    - **DMDBORN4**: Country of birth.
    - **DMDEDUC2**: Education level.
    - **WTINTPRP**, **WTMECPRP**: Sampling weights for statistical analysis.

## Purpose of Analysis
This project demonstrates:
- Descriptive statistical methods using healthcare datasets.
- Data exploration techniques in **SAS** for healthcare research.
- The application of weighted analysis to account for survey sampling design.

### Example Objectives:
1. Analyze demographic distributions (e.g., age, gender, and ethnicity).
2. Explore health behavior patterns across different demographic groups.
3. Illustrate methods for handling missing data.

## Tools and Techniques
- **SAS** for data manipulation and analysis.
- Visualizations to interpret demographic and health trends.
- Weighted statistical analysis to reflect the survey design.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Use the provided SAS scripts to replicate descriptive analyses.
3. Refer to the CDC documentation to understand variable definitions and survey methodology.
